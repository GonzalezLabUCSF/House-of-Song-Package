GPU Hardware and dependencies
Geforce RTX 30 series. Suggest 40 or 50 series, minimum 8GB memory, for faster DLC training and analysis.
Nvidia package launcher
Nvidia app + latest studio driver
Specifically need the cudnn.dll file that is relevant to your version of DLC, GPU, version of windows, and computer setup. Put those dependencies in a non systems folder, like downloads. BUT NOT A CLOUD FOLDER LIKE DROPBOX OR ONEDRIVE.

Also, need to change you computer PATH environmental variable to include the folder of the dll and other files. Again, refer to my chatgpt conversation regarding setting up DLC in the teams chat.

4TB SSD for video acquisiton, and storing numpy files.
4-8TB general Storage is suggested

It takes 15 minutes to record activity, 15min per camera view to convert raw video frames to mp4, about 40 min to convert a individual video to a TTL synced and image corrected video, 2 hrs to analyze each video using DLC, 1/2 hr per male motif trying to match, and then 2 minutes to make figures.
